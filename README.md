# DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS JOURNEY 🚀

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** journey!
This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to various DSA problems,
organized by topics, with a focus on improving my problem-solving skills and understanding of core concepts.

## 💡 Goals and Purpose

- Strengthen my understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms.
- Develop efficient problem-solving skills.
- Document and share my learning journey with others.

## Progress Tracker

- [x] Arrays
  - [x] Alternate elements of an array
- [ ] String
